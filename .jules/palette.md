## 2025-01-31 - [Foundational UX: Repositories as Interfaces]
**Learning:** When a project is in its infancy and lacks a web UI, the repository itself (README, Pull Request templates) becomes the primary user interface for early adopters and contributors. Establishing accessibility and inclusiveness standards (like Bengali translations and PR checklists) early on sets a strong precedent for the application's eventual UI.
**Action:** Always check the repository's metadata and contribution flow for UX opportunities when the application code is not yet present or mature.
