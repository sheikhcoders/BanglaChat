## 2026-08-07 - Real-Time Screen Reader Feedback in Chat Interfaces

**Learning:** Chat interfaces require dynamic screen reader feedback. Using `role="log"` coupled with `aria-live="polite"` ensures new messages are announced automatically without disrupting user input. Using programmatic `.append()` and `document.createTextNode` completely prevents XSS vulnerabilities while keeping code secure and maintainable.
**Action:** Always use secure textNode rendering and `role="log"` with `aria-live="polite"` for activity logs.
